Question
Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer, M.The second line contains M space-separated integers.The third line contains an integer, N.The fourth line contains N space-separated integers.
